# Mini Data Analysis - Fanny Dupont


This repository contains the UBC [STAT 545](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/) mini data analysis for [Fanny Dupont](https://github.com/Fanny-Dupont) part 2. 

## File description

The [README.md](./README.md/) file includes a description of the project.
The [milestone2.Rmd](./Milestone2/milestone2.Rmd) file and its markdown format. The code explores the dataset **vancouver_trees** and can be previewed through Github. The additionnal [output](./output) file contains the summary table that I made from Task 1 (Age variable per area) and the estimates obtained after fitting a linear model to the age of trees.

During the analysis, I go through **4** Tasks, to answer the following questions:

**Global dataset**

1. What are the areas with the most trees ? My intuition is that there are more as we go to the East of Vancouver

**New dataset**

2. Are there differences in age in the different areas ? 

3. What are significant differences between old and young, maybe indicating a recent change of policy in planting trees. I understand that since I don't have access to the whole dataset, (i.e., the trees that we planted and then dead), my conclusions are limited.

4. What could affect the age of trees: species, root_barrier ?


The most exciting findings of the analysis are that there are more trees in East Vancouver and that the variable `root_barrier` has a significant effect on the age of trees in Vancouver.
